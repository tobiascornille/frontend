                        AFT is a Leuven-based student organization. Our aim is to introduce students to technology and entrepreneurship and inspire in them a sense of entrepreneurship, a quintessential skill in todayâ€™s economy.
                        We provide technical students the opportunity to further develop their technical knowledge and reach out to non-technical students to introduce them to the wonderful world of technology.
